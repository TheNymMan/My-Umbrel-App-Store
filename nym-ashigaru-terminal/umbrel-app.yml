  First release of the Ashigaru Terminal built from Sparrow Wallet v1.8.4. The GUI has been removed in favor of a user-friendly terminal interface familiar to Sparrow Server users. 
  
  
  Ashigaru Terminal is a non-custodial Whirlpool client that lets users join chosen pools, enhance their transaction anonymity, and remain fully in control of their funds without needing a Dojo server.
